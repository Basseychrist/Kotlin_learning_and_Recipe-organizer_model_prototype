## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Java 11+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baseychrist/recipe-organizer.git
cd recipe-organizer
```

### Running the Application

```bash
kotlinc -d out src/main/kotlin/*.kt src/main/kotlin/**/*.kt
java -cp out MainKt
```

## Usage

Once running, the console menu provides options to:

1. **Manage Recipes** - Add, view, and delete recipes
2. **Filter Recipes** - Find recipes by ingredients, time, or tags
3. **Generate Meal Plans** - Create daily or weekly meal plans
4. **View Grocery Lists** - See all ingredients needed for a meal plan
5. **Exit** - Close the application

## Example: Adding a Recipe

```
Enter recipe name: Pasta Carbonara
Enter ingredients (name,quantity,unit): eggs,4,
                                      bacon,200,grams
                                      pasta,500,grams
Enter cooking time (minutes): 20
Enter difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard): Easy
Enter tags (breakfast,lunch,etc): lunch,dinner
```

## Architecture

### Core Classes

- **Recipe**: Immutable recipe with name, ingredients, cooking time, difficulty, tags
- **Ingredient**: Represents quantity and unit of an ingredient
- **MealPlan**: Single day plan with breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks
- **RecipeManager**: CRUD operations and filtering logic
- **MealPlanner**: Generates meal plans based on preferences

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

✓ **Variable Scope**: Local vs. class-level variables in Kotlin  
✓ **Collections**: Lists, Sets, Maps for recipe storage and filtering  
✓ **Lambdas**: Functional filtering and searching  
✓ **Data Classes**: Immutable model objects  
✓ **Extension Functions**: Custom operations on collections
